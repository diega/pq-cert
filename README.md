# Introduction

LACChain DNS is a Decentralized Name Service that helps to maintain a registry of verified entities through a set of certificates issued by Certification Authorities (CA) associated with a DID (ethr). 
Certificates will be used to register and validate the entity in an Ethereum Smart contract, which we called: **DNSRegistry**.

# DID Issuance
In order to register a DID in the DNS service, it must be generated from a valid X.509 certificate. The steps for the generation of the certificates are described in the section below.

![DID Issuance](did_issuance.png?raw=true "DID Issuance Diagram") 

In the previous diagram it is possible to see the process for the issuance of a DID through a certifying authority, 
making use of different X.509 certificates validated by a root CA. 
The applicant must previously have a valid certificate (usually SSL), and a set of Ethereum keys in order to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). 
Optionally, you can add a Post-Quantum key pair in the certificate request. 
As a final step, the certificate issued will have embedded both: the certificate data (SSL), as well as the Ethereum and Post-Quantum keys (if applicable)

## Generate Certificates

In order to validate the data of the entity to be registered in the DNS, it is necessary to have a valid X.509 certificate issued by a certifying entity (CA). Likewise, it is necessary to generate a request signing certificate (CSR) with the ethereum keys to send to the Post-Quantum Certification Authority and a certificate is generated under the hierarchy of said root CA.

Optionally, an X.509 v3 certificate with Post-Quantum keys can be generated to add these keys as attributes in the CSR that will be sent to the Post-Quantum Certificate Authority.

### 1. Ethereum-based Certificate Request (CSR)
Ethereum keys are based on the secp256k1 elliptical curve algorithm. 
It is possible to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using the key pair of an Ethereum account, 
but for this it is necessary to specify the details using the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN1).

```
asn1 = SEQUENCE:seq_section
 
[seq_section]
version    = INTEGER:01
privateKey = FORMAT:HEX,OCT:<ethereum private key hex>
parameters = EXPLICIT:0,OID:secp256k1
publicKey  = EXPLICIT:1,FORMAT:HEX,BITSTR:04<ethereum public key hex>
```

Finally, the CSR can be built with the following openssl commands with an intermediate step over a DER format key expressed in the ASN.1 file.

```
> openssl asn1parse -noout -genconf ethereum.asn1 -out eth_private_key.der 
> openssl ec -inform DER -in eth_private_key.der -out eth_private_key.pem 
> openssl req -new -key eth_private_key.pem -days 365 -out eth_certificate_request.csr
```

There is also an alternative way using docker-compose. To generate the ethereum CSR, you need to edit the ``PRIVATE_KEY`` and ``PUBLIC_KEY`` variables in the docker-compose.yml,
once you have settled that variables, just execute the following commands:

```shell
$ docker-compose run ethereum
```

**Note:** Don't forget to change the ``SUBJECT`` environment variable in the docker-compose.yml file. This variable will be passed to the openssl command, refer to [E24191](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24191_01/common/tutorials/authz_cert_attributes.html) to see the subject format and fields.

### 2. Post-Quantum CSR

In order to generate the Post-Quantum certificate it is necessary to have the openssl custom library installed. 
However there is a dockerfile available in the /generator directory, which have the container with the custom openssl
to generate post-quantum certificates.

To deploy the docker container, you need to execute the following commands:

```shell
$ docker-compose run quantum
```

**Note:** Don't forget to change the ``SUBJECT`` environment variable in the docker-compose.yml file. This variable will be passed to the openssl command, refer to [E24191](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24191_01/common/tutorials/authz_cert_attributes.html) to see the subject format and fields.

The previous command will generate a new post-quantum CSR (using Dilithium2 algorithm) in the /out directory, with their respective private key.  

## 3. Certificate Generation

The process to generate the certificate, is as follows:
1. The Post-Quantum CA verifies the subject of Applicant Certificate, Ethereum CSR and Post-Quantum CSR to be equal.
2. Generate Certificate with Applicant Certificate subject, Post-Quantum Public Key and Ethereum Public Key as x.509 v3 attribute.

The process described above can be performed with the following docker-compose command:

```bash
$ docker-compose run generator
```

Don't forget to mount the volumes corresponding to the root CA certificate rootCA and applicant CRT in the docker-compose.yml file.

```
volumes:
    - <Applicant Certificate>:/main.crt
    - <Root CA Private Key>:/root_ca.key
    - <Root CA Certificate>:/root_ca.crt
```

## 4. DID Issuance

The process to issue a DID, is as follows:

1. Generate a DID with a temporary Ethereum KeyPair
2. Add the Post-Quantum Public Key to the DID
3. Change the owner of the DID to Ethereum address from Ethereum CSR
4. Delete temporary Ethereum KeyPair

```bash
$ docker-compose run did
```

Before to execute the **```did```** docker command, you must edit the environment variables in the docker-compose.yml file.

```
- ETHR_REGISTRY: "<EthrRegistry Contract Address>"
- WEB3_RPC: <Ethereum RPC http url>
- CERTIFICATE: <Certificate File Name>
- NETWORK_ID: <Ethereum Network ID>
```

Finally, make sure that your certificate (CRT) generated in the previous step is mounted in the volumes section.
``` 
volumes:
  - ./out/certificate.crt:/app/<Certificate File Name>
```
